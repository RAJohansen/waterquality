# waterquality

The main purpose of **waterquality** is to quickly and easily convert satellite-based reflectance imagery into one or many well-known water quality algorithms designed for the detection of harmful algal blooms or the following pigment proxies: chlorophyll-a, blue-green algae (Phycocyanin), and Turbidity. Currently, this package is able to process [45 algorithms](https://rajohansen.github.io/waterquality/reference/index.html) for the following satellite-based imagers: WorldView-2, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, MODIS, MERIS, and OLCI. In order to improve the aesthetics of the `wq_calc` output, we are developing a series of `Map_WQ` functions which may reduce technical barriers and simplify the complexities in selecting a map layout. Additional functionality of the package include a series of `extract_lm` functions wrap that ["Fitting Linear Models"](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/lm) and the ["caret"](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html) packages to quickly generate crossvalidated linear model and standardized outputs (r^2, p-value, slope, intercept of the global lm model & average r^2, average RMSE, average MAE of crossvalidated model) for any number of algorithm and water quality parameters combinations. It is important to note that the `extract_lm` functions require ground-truth data in order to develop the models. For a more detailed look into the full functionality of **waterquality** please view ["Introduction to the waterquality package"](https://rajohansen.github.io/waterquality/articles/waterquality_vignette.html). For a broader look into how to apply this tool into a research workflow or for more information on topics such as data acquisition, image pre-processing, or results, see our publication entitled ["Waterquality: An Open-Source R Package for the Detection and Quantification of Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms and Water Quality"](https://erdc-library.erdc.dren.mil/jspui/bitstream/11681/35053/3/ERDC-EL%20TR-19-20.pdf).  

## Installation

You can install the released version from CRAN with:

```{r install_CRAN, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("waterquality")
```

You can install waterquality from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RAJohansen/waterquality")
```

## Basic Example

The main function in this package is `wq_calc()`:

```{r example 1 code, fig.asp=0.33, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(waterquality)
library(raster)
s2 = stack(system.file("raster/S2_Harsha.tif", package = "waterquality"))
s2_two_alg = wq_calc(s2, alg = c("TurbChip09NIROverGreen", "Be16FLHGreenRedNIR"), sat = "sentinel2")
```
```{r example 1 output, fig.asp=0.33}
plot(s2_two_alg)
```


## Package Contributions

We encourage users to submit issues and enhancement requests so we may continue to improve our package. 

Furthermore, if you have a water quality algorithm that was not on our list, and you would like for it to be included in our package please email me at Richard.A.Johansen@erdc.dren.mil

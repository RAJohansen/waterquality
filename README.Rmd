# waterquality

The main purpose of **waterquality** is to quickly and easily convert satellite-based reflectance imagery into one or many well-known water quality indices designed for the detection of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) using the following pigment proxies: chlorophyll-a, blue-green algae (phycocyanin), and turbidity. 
Currently, this package is able to process [40 algorithms](https://rajohansen.github.io/waterquality/reference/index.html) for the following satellite-based imagers: WorldView-2, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, MODIS, MERIS, and OLCI.
In order to improve the aesthetics of the `wq_calc()` output, a series of `Map_WQ()` functions were developed to help reduce technical barriers and simplify the complexities in selecting a map layout.
Additional functionality of the package includes a series of `extract_lm()` functions that wrap the ["Fitting Linear Models"](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/lm) and ["caret"](https://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html) packages to quickly generate crossvalidated linear models and standardized outputs (r^2^, p-value, slope, intercept of the global lm model & average r^2^, average RMSE, average MAE of crossvalidated model) for any number of algorithm and water quality parameter combinations. 
It is important to note that the `extract_lm()` functions require ground-truth data in order to develop the models. 
For a more detailed look into the full functionality of **waterquality**, please view ["Introduction to the waterquality package"](https://rajohansen.github.io/waterquality/articles/waterquality_vignette.html). 
For a broader look into how to apply this tool into a research workflow or for more information on topics such as data acquisition, image pre-processing, or results, see our publication entitled ["Waterquality: An Open-Source R Package for the Detection and Quantification of Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms and Water Quality"](https://erdc-library.erdc.dren.mil/jspui/bitstream/11681/35053/3/ERDC-EL%20TR-19-20.pdf).  

Additionally, we have recently developed and published a complementary python-based version of **waterquality** compatible with ESRI ArcGIS and ArcPro. For more information please visit [“waterquality for ArcGIS Pro Toolbox”](https://hdl.handle.net/11681/42240)

## Installation

You can install the released version from CRAN with:

```{r install_CRAN, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("waterquality")
```

You can install waterquality from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RAJohansen/waterquality")
```

## Basic Example

The main function in this package is `wq_calc()`:

```{r example_code, fig.asp=0.33, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(waterquality)
library(terra)
s2 = terra::rast(system.file("raster/S2_Harsha.tif", package = "waterquality"))
MM12NDCI = wq_calc(s2, alg = "MM12NDCI", sat = "sentinel2")
```
```{r,fig.height = 5, fig.width = 6}
Map_WQ_raster(WQ_raster = MM12NDCI,
              map_title= "Water Quality Map",
              raster_style = "quantile",
              histogram = TRUE)
```


## Package Contributions

We encourage users to submit issues and enhancement requests so we may continue to improve our package. 

Furthermore, if you have a water quality algorithm that was not on our list, and you would like for it to be included in our package please email Richard.A.Johansen@erdc.dren.mil.
